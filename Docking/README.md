```1wco_N.pdb```- This is the nisin part of the pdb file for nisin downloaded from the proten data bank. It has the molecular structure that corresponds to Nisin A.

```2012_ADTtut.pdf``` - This is the pdf file that explains how to use the Autodock software. Follow the same steps outlined in the pdf but use ```1wco_N.pdb``` in place of ```ind.pdb``` and ```4Y68_A.pdb``` in place of ```hsg1.pdb```.

```4Y68_A.pdb``` - This is one of the 4 NSR monomers downloaded from the Protein Data Bank.

```config.txt``` - This file contains the parameters required by Autodock during the docking procedure for nisin into NSR.

```nisnPROVAL.pdb``` - This is pdb file created from mutating the ```1wco_N.pdn``` file in the Chimera software so that the SER residue and the isoleucine residue change to the proline and valine residues respectively.  

```034-chimera_vina.pdf``` - This is a pdf file that outlines visually the steps to be used (up to but not including "set ligand options) in the event that the error occurs as stated in the update:28/07/18.


UPDATE: 28/07/18
================

Following the steps in Exercies 1 in ```2012_ADTtut.pdf``` may result in an error. When performing step 3 and after the HOH* and * have been added a different warning appears saying no atoms have been selected

If this happens close Autodock (not saving the project) and open up Chimera. You can use Chimera to perform Autodock Prep (essentially Exercise 1 as would have been performed in the auto dock procedure). After starting Chimera open the protein file (```4Y68_A.pdb```). From the pull down menu go to "tools" in the menu bar and select "Surface Binding Analysis" and then "Dock-Prep". Then click "OK" for the next 4 pop-up windows. Then save the file as ```4Y68_A.mol2```. (For a visual guide to these steps see the ```034-chimera_vina.pdf``` document). Then close Chimera. Then open up the ```4Y68_A.mol2``` file in Chimera. Then save it as ```protein.pdb``` Then open up Autodock and proceed from Exercise 2 of ```2012_ADTtut.pdf```. In Exercise 3 select the new protein file you created from Chimera Dock-prep procedure (```protein.pdb```) as the molecule to be selected and save it as a pdbqt file as per the instructions in the exercise. Then follow the rest of the exercises to complete the docking procedure.

Alternative procedure for docking can be found here https://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/users/greg/teaching/docking-2012.html 
Have also uploaded alternative procedure as a pdf "introduction to in-sillico docking"
